This resource is an simple resource working for RedM.
This will help you navigate the endless animations built into rdr2.

```
A full animationlist can be found -> https://rdr2.mooshe.tv/animations/
```

The script is fully standalone and has no dependencies.
To use the script, type /animplayer in the chat. The nui will be brought up, which can be exited by pressing ESCAPE.

> This is essential in finding new animations, yet nothing about this can be found on github nor cfx. Just one script thats outdated, hence why i created this.

This script is free to use, but not to publish as your own.
If you are having any questions or issues, please raise them here on github, and ill or others will assist you!

:)
