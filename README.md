This resource is an simple resource working for RedM. 
This will help you navigate the endless animations built into rdr2. 
```
A full animationlist can be found -> https://rdr2.mooshe.tv/animations/ 
```

To use the script, type /animplayer in the chat. The nui will be brought up, which can be exited by pressing ESCAPE. This resource is simple but is a nice add to a dev-server in the making of trying new animations to add into an already working animation script for roleplaying.

> This is essential in finding new animations, yet nothing about this can be found on github nor cfx. Just one script thats outdated, hence why i created this.


This script is free do download and use, but you cant publish this as your own making. Instead link this to your fellow developers.
If you are having any questions or issues, please raise them here on github issues, and ill or others will assist you!.
